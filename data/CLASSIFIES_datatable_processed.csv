Mean reflects the population parameter: Ideally, with enough samples, the average of the statistic across these samples (i.e., the mean of the sampling distribution) would converge to the true population parameter (e.g., population mean, population proportion).
Bootstrap distribution:

Resampled from the sample: This distribution is created by repeatedly taking samples with replacement from a single, already drawn sample. It estimates the variability of the statistic if you were to keep drawing samples from just that specific sample.
Captures the sample bias: Since it's based solely on one sample, the bootstrap distribution reflects the sampling bias inherent in that particular sample. This bias can pull the mean of the bootstrap distribution away from the true population parameter.

Perfectly representative sample: If the single sample used for bootstrapping perfectly captures the population, meaning it has no sampling bias and exactly reflects the population parameters, then the bootstrap distribution and the sampling distribution will have the same mean.

The original sample is perfectly balanced: If the original sample has a perfect balance of high and low values, resampling with replacement doesn't introduce significant bias, and the bootstrap mean can closely match the true population mean.
The population distribution is symmetrical: If the underlying population distribution is perfectly symmetrical (e.g., normal distribution), resampling with replacement doesn't introduce directional bias, and the bootstrap distribution can again match the population mean.
However, such situations are relatively uncommon, and in most scenarios, the bootstrap and sampling distributions will exhibit slightly different means due to the inherent bias introduced by resampling.",1,PSU_q1,,

For bootstrapping, the distribution is built by sampling with replacement from an observed data set that is assumed to be representative of the population and this means that the mean can be more variable because it is different samples taken from the same original data set. For sampling distributions, sampling is taken using properties of the population and random samples are taken without replacement and it assumes a specific distribution. The mean for sampling distributions eventually centers on the population mean because each sample is unique and taken from the population. Mostly due to the replacement of bootstrap and non-replacement of sampling causes the mean for the bootstrap to be at the observed sample statistic and the sampling distribution to be at the population parameter.

Yes this is possible as long as the sample for bootstrapping is large enough to represent the population distribution and the sampling distribution is large enough. If the bootstrap sample is representative of the population, eventually with enough samples taken, it would reach close to the population mean as it would resemble to original sample and the original sample would represent the population.

Null and Alternative Hypotheses:
   - Null Hypothesis (H₀): The patient does not have the disease.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The patient has the disease.
Type 1 Error (False Positive):
   - A Type 1 error in this context would mean incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis and concluding that the patient has the disease when, in reality, they do not. This is akin to a ""false positive"" diagnosis.

Type 2 Error (False Negative):
   - A Type 2 error would occur if we fail to reject the null hypothesis when the patient actually has the disease. In other words, the test erroneously indicates that the patient is disease-free, a ""false negative"" result.

Consequences of Errors:
   - **Type 1 Error (False Positive):** The patient might undergo unnecessary treatments, causing emotional distress and potential side effects. Additionally, healthcare resources could be misallocated.
   
Type 2 Error (False Negative): The patient may not receive timely treatment, allowing the disease to progress undetected, potentially leading to serious health complications. Furthermore, public health efforts might not be adequately targeted.

In this medical context, achieving a balance between minimizing both types of errors is crucial. The consequences associated with each type of error emphasize the importance of carefully considering the implications of hypothesis testing outcomes, as they directly impact individuals' health and the efficient allocation of healthcare resources.

R_RLjkGs6dGxMaFGx_PSU_q2,"An example from a homework assignment that will be used is when a survey from the United Kingdom showed the average birth weight is 7 pounds but a doctor suspects that the birth weight has increased in recent years.

The null hypothesis in a hypotheses test states that there is no difference found whereas, for the alternative hypothesis, it is suggested that there is a difference. The null hypothesis in this test would have the mean set equal to 7 and the alternative hypothesis set the mean higher than 7.

The meaning of a type 1 error is when we reject the null hypothesis that is actually true but this turns out to be a false positive as it can possibly lead to incorrect decisions being made. In this context, it means that the average does not equal 7 pounds as the birth weight and is in fact higher than 7 since we reject the null.  

The meaning of a type 2 error is when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false and this can lead to a false negative as it can cause consequences such as in medical experiments. In this context, it can mean that the alternative hypothesis is actually correct but instead, we side with the null hypothesis which is actually false. 

Both of these errors can lead to insufficient information and incorrect decisions which can potentially mess up an entire experiment.",0,PSU_q2,,

R_DOvncP7cS2avQIx_PSU_q2,"Example: Clinical Drug Trial

Null Hypothesis (H0): The new drug has no effect on reducing blood pressure.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The new drug is effective in reducing blood pressure.

Type I Error (False Positive):
A Type I error in this context would occur if the study incorrectly concludes that the new drug is effective (rejects the null hypothesis) when, in reality, it has no impact on reducing blood pressure. This could lead to the drug being approved and marketed based on a false claim of effectiveness.

Type II Error (False Negative):
A Type II error would happen if the study fails to detect the effectiveness of the new drug (fails to reject the null hypothesis) when, in fact, it does reduce blood pressure. This could result in the drug not being approved, depriving patients of a potentially beneficial treatment.

Consequences:

Type I Error (False Positive):

Consequence: Patients might be prescribed and use a drug that doesn't actually work, leading to unnecessary expenses and potential side effects.
Ethical Consideration: False claims of effectiveness could erode trust in the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare system.
Type II Error (False Negative):

Consequence: Patients miss out on a drug that could effectively treat their condition, potentially leading to worsened health outcomes.
Ethical Consideration: Denying access to a beneficial treatment raises ethical concerns about the well-being of study participants and future patients.
In both cases, the consequences highlight the importance of carefully controlling Type I and Type II error rates in hypothesis testing, as they directly impact decisions with real-world implications for individuals and public health.

Type 1 Error (False Positive):
Making a Type 1 error in this context would mean incorrectly concluding that there is a difference in the mean prices of the new and older versions when, in reality, there is no such difference. It's a false positive, suggesting an effect of newness on price when there isn't one.

Type 1 Error would occur when it is concluded that option B is more likely to be correct when, in reality, there is no significant difference in the likelihood of all options.

Type 2 Error would happen if when it is failed to detect that option B is more likely to be correct when, in fact, it is.

Consequences of Type 1 Error: If a Type 1 error occurs, and it is incorrectly concluded that option B is more likely to be correct, it may lead to biased test strategies. This could result in potential disadvantages for students on the actual exams.

Consequences of Type 2 Error: If a Type 2 error occurs, and the test fails to detect that option B is more likely to be correct, students might not receive the correct guidance on effective test-taking strategies. This could lead to a negative impact on the performance of AP exams.

1. 
Null Hypothesis: There is no linear association between systolic blood pressure and heart rate in the population.
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a positive linear association between systolic blood pressure and heart rate in the population.

In this example the null hypothesis is ""the use of flipper bands does not have significant effect on the survival rate of king penguins"" and the alternative hypothesis is ""the use of flipper bands does have significant effect on the survival rate of king penguins"" 

A type 1 error would mean that the conclusion was made that the use of flippers bands has a significant effect on the survival rates and breeding success of king penguins when in reality there is no effect. 

A type 2 error would be vis-versus. It means that there was a failure to detect a significant effect of flipper bands on king penguins survival rates and breeding success when this effect actually does exist. 

The consequences of these errors may be large. In a type 1 error unnecessary change may be implemented which would be a waste of resources and could actually leave the penguins worse off as well as their ecosystem. On the other hand, In a type 2 error a real effect may not be recognized leading to a lack of measures on changing the bands for the penguin. This could lead to harm to the penguins and a decline in their population.  

The lab question is implemented below. 
""Penguins are excellent indicators of the state of health of marine ecosystems and thus make it possible to better understand the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Until now, most of the available data has been obtained by banding the penguin with a metal tag on the flipper so that data can be obtained from a distance. However, the use of flipper bands does raise serious questions as they can have deleterious effects on the penguins which include injuring flipper tissues or increasing energy expenditure while swimming or fishing due to the hydrodynamic drag effect on the flippers that the penguins use to propel themselves. Such long-term practices could harm penguin populations which are already under threat from other environmental factors.

This is the first study where one hundred king penguins had electronic tags implanted under their skin. By random assignment, half were also fitted with a flipper band such that 50 were banded and 50 were not banded. Over a ten-year period, differences in both survival rate and reproduction (breeding success) were examined when comparing the two groups. We will consider survival rates in this lab.""

R_emHIMtbfMBGJYHf_PSU_q2,"**Example: Medical Testing for a Disease**

1. Null Hypothesis (H0):
   - (H0): The patient does not have the disease.

   The null hypothesis typically represents a default or status quo assumption. In this case, it assumes that the patient is healthy or does not have the disease being tested.

2. Alternative Hypothesis (Ha) or (H1):
   - (Ha): The patient has the disease.

   The alternative hypothesis is what the researcher aims to support. It suggests that the patient does have the disease, and it represents a departure from the null hypothesis.

So, in summary:
- (H0): The patient does not have the disease.
- (Ha): The patient has the disease.

Type 1 Error (False Positive):
A Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected when it is actually true. In the context of medical testing:
False Positive: The test indicates that the patient has the disease (rejects (H0)), but in reality, the patient does not have the disease.

Consequence of Type 1 Error:
- The patient may undergo unnecessary treatment or stress related to the false diagnosis.
- Resources could be wasted on further medical procedures or interventions.

Type 2 Error (False Negative):
A Type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false. In the medical testing context:
- False Negative: The test indicates that the patient does not have the disease (fails to reject H0), but in reality, the patient does have the disease.

Consequence of Type 2 Error:
- The patient may not receive necessary treatment, leading to potential health complications.
- There could be a missed opportunity for early intervention and management of the disease.

Using the example from the lab about the drug: 

Null and Alternative Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H0): The new drug has no effect on the medical condition; any observed differences are due to random chance.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The new drug is effective in treating the medical condition; there is a significant difference compared to a placebo.
Type 1 Error (False Positive):

Meaning: This occurs if we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true, indicating that we conclude the drug is effective when it has no real impact.
Consequences: Patients might be prescribed a potentially ineffective drug, leading to unnecessary costs, side effects, and potential delays in exploring other, more effective treatments.
Type 2 Error (False Negative):

Meaning: This occurs if we fail to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is true, indicating that we conclude the drug is not effective when it actually is.
Consequences: Patients could miss out on a beneficial treatment, facing continued health issues or the need for alternative, possibly less effective, interventions.
Potential Consequences:

Making a Type 1 Error may result in unnecessary resource allocation and potential harm to patients.
Making a Type 2 Error may lead to missed opportunities for effective treatments and continued health issues.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The new drug has a significant effect, and there is a difference in outcomes between the treated and untreated groups.
Type 1 Error (False Positive):
In this context, a Type 1 error would occur if we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the new drug is effective when, in reality, it has no effect. The consequence of this error could lead to the adoption of an ineffective treatment, exposing patients to potential side effects and unnecessary costs.

Type 2 Error (False Negative):
Conversely, a Type 2 error would happen if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the new drug is not effective when it is. The consequence of a Type 2 error may result in withholding a beneficial treatment from patients, potentially delaying their recovery or preventing access to a more effective medication.

Potential Consequences:

Type 1 Error: Unwarranted adoption of an ineffective treatment, leading to unnecessary costs, potential side effects, and a misuse of resources.
Type 2 Error: Failure to recognize the effectiveness of the new drug, resulting in delayed or denied access to a beneficial treatment, and potentially compromising patient outcomes.

Null Hypothesis (H0): A new drug does not significantly reduce blood pressure compared to the current standard medication.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The new drug significantly reduces blood pressure compared to the current standard medication.
Type 1 Error (False Positive):
Meaning: This occurs if the study concludes that the new drug is more effective at reducing blood pressure when, in reality, it is not.
Consequences: This could lead to the unnecessary replacement of a standard drug with a less effective one, potentially compromising patient health and causing unwarranted financial costs for patients and healthcare systems.
Type 2 Error (False Negative):
Meaning: This occurs if the study concludes that the new drug is not more effective at reducing blood pressure when it actually is.
Consequences: A beneficial drug might be overlooked, denying patients a potentially more effective treatment. This would also halt further research and development of the drug, possibly affecting future patient care advancements.

In this context, understanding the implications of Type 1 and Type 2 errors is crucial as it directly impacts patient health and the effective allocation of healthcare resources.

-Type I Error (False Positive): If the researchers claim the new drug is effective (when it's not), patients might be exposed to unnecessary treatments. 

-Type II Error (False Negative): If the researchers fail to recognize the effectiveness of the new drug, patients might miss out on a beneficial treatment.

Null and Alternative Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (The new drug has no effect, and there is no difference in outcomes between the treatment group and the control group.

Alternative Hypothesis The new drug is effective, and there is a significant difference in outcomes between the treatment group and the control group.

Type I Error (False Positive):

In this context, a Type I error would occur if the statistical test incorrectly rejects the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In other words, it would mean concluding that the new drug is effective when, in reality, it has no impact. This could lead to the drug being approved and introduced to the market when it doesn't provide any real benefits.

A Type II error would occur if the statistical test fails to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. In this scenario, it would mean failing to recognize the effectiveness of the new drug when, in fact, it could have positive effects. This could result in the rejection of a potentially beneficial treatment.
Consequences of Errors:

Type II Error (False Negative): Failing to recognize the effectiveness of the drug could deny patients access to a potentially beneficial treatment. This may lead to missed opportunities for improving health outcomes and quality of life. It could also result in prolonged suffering or reliance on less effective or more invasive treatments.

Null and Alternative Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H₀): The new drug has no significant effect on patient recovery.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The new drug significantly improves patient recovery.
Type 1 Error (False Positive):
In this context, a Type 1 error would occur if the study concludes that the new drug is effective (rejects the null hypothesis) when, in reality, it has no significant effect. This could lead the pharmaceutical company to invest in the production and marketing of a drug that doesn't provide the expected benefits.

Type 2 Error (False Negative):
A Type 2 error would happen if the study fails to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the new drug is ineffective when it actually has a significant positive impact on patient recovery. This could result in the rejection or discontinuation of a potentially beneficial drug.

Potential Consequences:

Type 1 Error (False Positive): The company may incur substantial financial losses by investing in the production of a drug that doesn't deliver the promised benefits. Additionally, patients might be exposed to a treatment that doesn't improve their condition.

Type 2 Error (False Negative): This error could lead to missed opportunities for a groundbreaking drug.

Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): Young adults want to spend more minutes talking with their parents when thinking about mortality compared to dental pain (μ=mortality > μ=dental pain).

Meaning: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
Context: A Type 1 error in this context occurs if researchers incorrectly conclude that young adults prefer more minutes of conversation about mortality when, in reality, there is no significant difference. 

Meaning: Failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.
Context: A Type 2 error occurs if researchers fail to detect a genuine preference among young adults for more minutes of conversation about mortality compared to dental pain. 

Type 1 Error: The potential consequence is implementing unnecessary interventions or policies based on the assumption of a preference for discussing mortality, leading to misallocation of resources and potential discomfort for young adults.

Null Hypothesis (H0): The new drug has no effect on treating the disease, meaning its efficacy is the same as the placebo.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The new drug is effective in treating the disease, meaning it has a different efficacy than the placebo.

Type 1 Error (False Positive): This error would occur if we conclude that the new drug is effective when it is not. In this context, a Type 1 error means we mistakenly believe the drug works against the disease when it actually does not have a significant therapeutic effect. The consequences of this error could include patients being exposed to an ineffective treatment, potential side effects, and unnecessary healthcare costs.

Type 2 Error (False Negative): This error happens if we conclude that the new drug is not effective when it actually is. In this scenario, a Type 2 error means failing to recognize the genuine efficacy of the drug. The consequences could be missing out on a beneficial treatment for patients, continued use of less effective treatments, and a delay in the adoption of a more effective therapy.

Null Hypothesis (H0): The new drug is no more effective than the current standard treatment.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The new drug is more effective than the current standard treatment.
Type I Error (False Positive):
In this context, a Type I error occurs if we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the new drug is more effective when it actually is not.
This might happen if, due to random sample variation, the test group taking the new drug shows better outcomes than the control group, even though the drug is not truly more effective.
Type II Error (False Negative):
A Type II error occurs if we incorrectly fail to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the new drug is not more effective than the standard treatment when it actually is.
This error might happen if the sample size is too small or the effect of the drug is not strong enough to be detected by the test, leading us to miss a genuine improvement over the standard treatment.
Consequences:
Consequences of a Type I Error: Unnecessarily switching to or promoting a new drug that is no more effective than the standard, potentially wasting resources and giving patients false hope.

The explanatory variable, also known as the independent variable, is the one that is posited to influence or predict changes in another variable. In other words, it is the variable you manipulate or think has an effect on the outcome. Here, the consumption of fruit is being considered as a potential factor that could explain or contribute to changes in obesity rates.

The response variable, also known as the dependent variable, is the outcome of interest that you measure to see if it is affected by changes in the explanatory variable. In this case, the response variable is the percentage of residents who are obese, which you are trying to predict or explain through the fruit consumption variable.

The rationale is that dietary habits, such as fruit consumption, may have an effect on an individual's likelihood of being obese. Researchers are often interested in how modifying the explanatory variable (increasing fruit consumption) could potentially influence the response variable (rates of obesity).

Explanatory Variable: This is the independent variable that is presumed to influence or explain changes in the response variable. In this case, the ""percentage of residents who ate fruit at least once per day"" is the factor that is being examined to understand its potential impact on the ""percentage of residents who are obese."" The assumption is that healthier eating habits, represented by the consumption of fruit, may have an influence on obesity rates.

Response Variable: This is the dependent variable, the outcome that researchers are interested in predicting or explaining. Here, the ""percentage of residents who are obese"" is the response variable, and it is expected to be influenced or affected by the level of fruit consumption.

In summary, the explanatory variable is the one believed to have a causal effect on the response variable, and in this case, the focus is on understanding how the percentage of residents who eat fruit might be associated with or impact the percentage of residents who are obese.

The explanatory variable is the one that is believed to have an effect or influence on the other variable. In this case, it is reasonable to assume that the percentage of residents who eat fruit daily could influence the percentage of residents who are obese. As individuals consume more fruits, it might have a beneficial effect on their overall health and, consequently, on the prevalence of obesity. The response variable is the one that is expected to be influenced or affected by the explanatory variable. In this context, we anticipate that the percentage of residents who are obese is responding to or being influenced by the percentage of residents who consume fruit daily.

Observing the general trend, it appears that, irrespective of the city, there is a positive correlation between house size and sale price. In other words, larger houses tend to have higher sale prices. Additionally, there seems to be variability in this relationship based on the city, with some variations in the distribution of points for Fort Lauderdale compared to Miami.

In looking at the scatterplot above, the first thing I noticed with regards to the relationship between house sale price, city, and square footage is the fact that for both cities (Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Miami, Florida): as square footage increases on the x-axis, the house sale price increases as well on the y-axis - meaning there is a positive correlation. For both cities in Florida, a line of best fit appears to be shown in both red and blue. In Miami, Florida, the red solid line of best fit is less slanted - for lack of better terms - than the blue dotted line for Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This means that for every unit increase (or every increase in the number of square footage), the house sale of price is lower or smaller in Miami than in Fort Lauderdale. For example, at 4,500 square footage, the price in Fort Lauderdale appears to be close to 3,000,000 while the price in Miami at the same square footage appears to be close to 2,500,000.

In the context of Fort Lauderdale and Miami, this implies that as the square footage of houses increases, their sale prices also tend to increase. The linear pattern indicates a consistent rate of change in house prices with respect to square footage.

It's important to note that this correlation is a general trend observed in the data. The fact that the scatterplot is linear implies a proportional relationship between the two variables, reinforcing the notion that larger houses generally command higher sale prices. The inclusion of both Fort Lauderdale and Miami in the analysis suggests that this relationship holds true across both cities, at least within the sampled data.

The general trend of the scatterplot can provide insights into the relationships between these variables. For instance, if houses in one city tend to have larger square footages and higher sale prices compared to the other, this could indicate a potential city-wise variation in the housing market. Additionally, examining the overall pattern and clustering of data points can reveal whether there's a positive, negative, or no apparent correlation between house size and sale price.

To offer a more specific interpretation, a regression analysis or correlation coefficient calculation may be required.

R_emHIMtbfMBGJYHf_PSU_q1,"The key distinction between the sampling distribution and the bootstrap distribution lies in their nature: the sampling distribution is a theoretical concept centered around the true population parameter, while the bootstrap distribution is an empirical approximation derived from resampling a single observed sample. The bootstrap method is particularly valuable when obtaining multiple samples from the population is challenging or expensive. Although the means of these distributions may differ, especially if the original sample is not perfectly representative, the bootstrap distribution still offers practical insights into the variability and uncertainty associated with a sample statistic. It is widely employed in statistical analysis, providing confidence intervals and standard errors, making it a useful tool in situations where obtaining repeated samples is impractical.

While it is theoretically possible for a bootstrap distribution and a sampling distribution to have the same mean, this is more of a coincidence than a general expectation. The two distributions differ fundamentally: the sampling distribution is derived from multiple random samples from a population, aiming to estimate the true population mean, while the bootstrap distribution is based on resampling from a single observed sample. The bootstrap distribution tends to have more variability due to the resampling process. The primary purpose of the bootstrap method is to provide an empirical estimate of variability and uncertainty associated with a sample statistic, rather than to precisely replicate the sampling distribution. If their means happen to match, it would be coincidental and not a common occurrence.

In some cases, the bootstrap distribution and the sampling distribution can have the same mean.
