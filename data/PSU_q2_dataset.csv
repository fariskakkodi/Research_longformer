Null and Alternative Hypotheses:
   - Null Hypothesis (H₀): The patient does not have the disease.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The patient has the disease.
Type 1 Error (False Positive):
   - A Type 1 error in this context would mean incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis and concluding that the patient has the disease when, in reality, they do not. This is akin to a ""false positive"" diagnosis.

Type 2 Error (False Negative):
   - A Type 2 error would occur if we fail to reject the null hypothesis when the patient actually has the disease. In other words, the test erroneously indicates that the patient is disease-free, a ""false negative"" result.

Consequences of Errors:
   - **Type 1 Error (False Positive):** The patient might undergo unnecessary treatments, causing emotional distress and potential side effects. Additionally, healthcare resources could be misallocated.
   
Type 2 Error (False Negative): The patient may not receive timely treatment, allowing the disease to progress undetected, potentially leading to serious health complications. Furthermore, public health efforts might not be adequately targeted.

In this medical context, achieving a balance between minimizing both types of errors is crucial. The consequences associated with each type of error emphasize the importance of carefully considering the implications of hypothesis testing outcomes, as they directly impact individuals' health and the efficient allocation of healthcare resources.

2. In this context, a Type I error would occur if we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the new drug is effective when it has no impact on blood pressure. This is a ""false positive"" or the erroneous belief that the drug works.

3. A Type II error would happen if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the drug has no effect when it does indeed lower blood pressure. This is a ""false negative"" or the failure to recognize the drug's effectiveness.

Potential Consequences: Patients might miss out on a potentially beneficial treatment, and the drug could be disregarded despite its effectiveness. This can lead to missed opportunities for improving patient outcomes and quality of life.",2,PSU_q2,,
R_1QabecUoEmsoLQQ_PSU_q2,"A null hypothesis states there is no relationship between two population parameters where as an alternative hypothesis suggests that there is in fact a relationship. An example for this could be a p-value being less than 0.05% where we can reject the null hypothesis that states that a healthy breakfast doesn't have a relationship with a productive day.

A type 1 error occurs if you reject the null hypothesis that is actually in the population. An example of this could be a covid test coming back saying you have covid when in fact you don't.

A type 2 error means not rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually false. An example of this could be the covid test says you do not have covid when in fact you actually do have covid.

The potential consequences associated with type 1 could be lost time and resources. A type 2 consequence could be a missed opportunity to change a project.",0,PSU_q2,,

With a medical test, the type 1 error would describe when the patient has a disease, when they don't. This is the reason why they call it a false positive, in this case someone could have to get more testing done, which could cause financial implications.

Type 2 Error (False Negative):
A type 2 error is when the test doesn't work and wouldn't test the patient for anything when in reality they actually have something wrong with them. The patient would really suffer here as he wouldn't know he is actually sick and needs help, when he wouldn't be able to get it because the test says he is fine.

1.Null and Alternative Hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis: The new drug is not effective in treating the disease.
Alternative Hypothesis: The new drug is effective in treating the disease.
2.Type I Error:
Type I error would occur if the test incorrectly concludes that the drug is effective (rejecting H0) when it actually is not. This is a false positive result.
3.Type II Error:
Type II error happens if the test fails to identify the drug's effectiveness (failing to reject H0) when the drug is actually effective. This is a false negative result.
4.Consequences of Errors:
Type I Error Consequences: Approving an ineffective drug could lead to wasted resources, potential health risks for patients using an ineffective treatment, and a delay in finding a truly effective treatment.
Type II Error Consequences: Not recognizing an effective drug means missing out on a potentially beneficial treatment, leading to continued suffering or health decline for patients who could have benefited from the drug.

R_RLjkGs6dGxMaFGx_PSU_q2,"An example from a homework assignment that will be used is when a survey from the United Kingdom showed the average birth weight is 7 pounds but a doctor suspects that the birth weight has increased in recent years.

The null hypothesis in a hypotheses test states that there is no difference found whereas, for the alternative hypothesis, it is suggested that there is a difference. The null hypothesis in this test would have the mean set equal to 7 and the alternative hypothesis set the mean higher than 7.

The meaning of a type 1 error is when we reject the null hypothesis that is actually true but this turns out to be a false positive as it can possibly lead to incorrect decisions being made. In this context, it means that the average does not equal 7 pounds as the birth weight and is in fact higher than 7 since we reject the null.  

The meaning of a type 2 error is when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false and this can lead to a false negative as it can cause consequences such as in medical experiments. In this context, it can mean that the alternative hypothesis is actually correct but instead, we side with the null hypothesis which is actually false.

Null Hypothesis (H0): The new drug has no effect on reducing blood pressure.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The new drug is effective in reducing blood pressure.

Type I Error (False Positive):
A Type I error in this context would occur if the study incorrectly concludes that the new drug is effective (rejects the null hypothesis) when, in reality, it has no impact on reducing blood pressure. This could lead to the drug being approved and marketed based on a false claim of effectiveness.

Type II Error (False Negative):
A Type II error would happen if the study fails to detect the effectiveness of the new drug (fails to reject the null hypothesis) when, in fact, it does reduce blood pressure. This could result in the drug not being approved, depriving patients of a potentially beneficial treatment.

Consequences:

Type I Error (False Positive):

Consequence: Patients might be prescribed and use a drug that doesn't actually work, leading to unnecessary expenses and potential side effects.
Ethical Consideration: False claims of effectiveness could erode trust in the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare system.
Type II Error (False Negative):

Consequence: Patients miss out on a drug that could effectively treat their condition, potentially leading to worsened health outcomes.
Ethical Consideration: Denying access to a beneficial treatment raises ethical concerns about the well-being of study participants and future patients.

-In this case, the corporation would make a Type I error (false positive) if it incorrectly determines that the medication is effective and has no therapeutic value. This might result in the drug being made available on the market before it should, endangering people.

R_2tz1prdYu1yj2IU_PSU_q2,"The example I choose was from the 6.1 and 6.3 lab activities. In the lab it talked about the the use of metal tabs on king penguins flippers that track climate change and whether or not these tabs had an effect on these penguins breeding success as well as survival rates. In this example the null hypothesis is ""the use of flipper bands does not have significant effect on the survival rate of king penguins"" and the alternative hypothesis is ""the use of flipper bands does have significant effect on the survival rate of king penguins"" 

A type 1 error would mean that the conclusion was made that the use of flippers bands has a significant effect on the survival rates and breeding success of king penguins when in reality there is no effect. 

A type 2 error would be vis-versus. It means that there was a failure to detect a significant effect of flipper bands on king penguins survival rates and breeding success when this effect actually does exist. 

The consequences of these errors may be large. In a type 1 error unnecessary change may be implemented which would be a waste of resources and could actually leave the penguins worse off as well as their ecosystem. On the other hand, In a type 2 error a real effect may not be recognized leading to a lack of measures on changing the bands for the penguin. This could lead to harm to the penguins and a decline in their population.  

The lab question is implemented below. 
""Penguins are excellent indicators of the state of health of marine ecosystems and thus make it possible to better understand the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Until now, most of the available data has been obtained by banding the penguin with a metal tag on the flipper so that data can be obtained from a distance. However, the use of flipper bands does raise serious questions as they can have deleterious effects on the penguins which include injuring flipper tissues or increasing energy expenditure while swimming or fishing due to the hydrodynamic drag effect on the flippers that the penguins use to propel themselves. Such long-term practices could harm penguin populations which are already under threat from other environmental factors.

This is the first study where one hundred king penguins had electronic tags implanted under their skin. By random assignment, half were also fitted with a flipper band such that 50 were banded and 50 were not banded. Over a ten-year period, differences in both survival rate and reproduction (breeding success) were examined when comparing the two groups. We will consider survival rates in this lab.""

R_emHIMtbfMBGJYHf_PSU_q2,"**Example: Medical Testing for a Disease**

1. Null Hypothesis (H0):
   - (H0): The patient does not have the disease.

   The null hypothesis typically represents a default or status quo assumption. In this case, it assumes that the patient is healthy or does not have the disease being tested.

2. Alternative Hypothesis (Ha) or (H1):
   - (Ha): The patient has the disease.

   The alternative hypothesis is what the researcher aims to support. It suggests that the patient does have the disease, and it represents a departure from the null hypothesis.

So, in summary:
- (H0): The patient does not have the disease.
- (Ha): The patient has the disease.

Type 1 Error (False Positive):
A Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected when it is actually true. In the context of medical testing:
False Positive: The test indicates that the patient has the disease (rejects (H0)), but in reality, the patient does not have the disease.

Consequence of Type 1 Error:
- The patient may undergo unnecessary treatment or stress related to the false diagnosis.
- Resources could be wasted on further medical procedures or interventions.

Type 2 Error (False Negative):
A Type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false. In the medical testing context:
- False Negative: The test indicates that the patient does not have the disease (fails to reject H0), but in reality, the patient does have the disease.

Consequence of Type 2 Error:
- The patient may not receive necessary treatment, leading to potential health complications.
- There could be a missed opportunity for early intervention and management of the disease.

Using the example from the lab about the drug: 

Null and Alternative Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H0): The new drug has no effect on the medical condition; any observed differences are due to random chance.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The new drug is effective in treating the medical condition; there is a significant difference compared to a placebo.
Type 1 Error (False Positive):

Meaning: This occurs if we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true, indicating that we conclude the drug is effective when it has no real impact.
Consequences: Patients might be prescribed a potentially ineffective drug, leading to unnecessary costs, side effects, and potential delays in exploring other, more effective treatments.
Type 2 Error (False Negative):

Meaning: This occurs if we fail to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is true, indicating that we conclude the drug is not effective when it actually is.
Consequences: Patients could miss out on a beneficial treatment, facing continued health issues or the need for alternative, possibly less effective, interventions.
Potential Consequences:

Making a Type 1 Error may result in unnecessary resource allocation and potential harm to patients.
Making a Type 2 Error may lead to missed opportunities for effective treatments and continued health issues.

In this context, a Type 1 error would occur if we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the new drug is effective when, in reality, it has no effect.

Type 2 Error (False Negative):
Conversely, a Type 2 error would happen if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the new drug is not effective when it is. The consequence of a Type 2 error may result in withholding a beneficial treatment from patients, potentially delaying their recovery or preventing access to a more effective medication.

Potential Consequences:

Type one error is a false positive meaning that we rejected the null hypothesis when there actually was no signifcant change or affect.  In this exmaple it would be rejecting the null hypothesis but in reality the height does not actually affect weight. 
explain the meaning of a type 2 error (i.e., a ""false negative"") in the chosen context;
Type two error is a false negative meaning that we accepted the null hypothesis when in relaity we should have rejected it because height does increase weight. 
describe the potential consequences associated with each type of wrong decision (i.e., type 1 or type 2 error).
Type1 error would create a problem because if you assume something affecting another but it really isn't that can be misleading, a waste of materials, unfair, and dangerous if it has to do with one thing affecting ones body.
Type 2 error can also create a problem as it can be misleading and unfair to someone if something is truly affecting them but the test says it is not.  Type 2 error also is bad because you are missing something important and that can be dangerous.

Null Hypothesis (The new drug has no effect, and there is no difference in outcomes between the treatment group and the control group.

Alternative Hypothesis The new drug is effective, and there is a significant difference in outcomes between the treatment group and the control group.

Type I Error (False Positive):

In this context, a Type I error would occur if the statistical test incorrectly rejects the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In other words, it would mean concluding that the new drug is effective when, in reality, it has no impact. This could lead to the drug being approved and introduced to the market when it doesn't provide any real benefits.

Type II Error (False Negative): Failing to recognize the effectiveness of the drug could deny patients access to a potentially beneficial treatment.

This might result in the rejection or shelving of a potentially beneficial treatment, impacting patient outcomes and healthcare advancements.

R_1mRD5whhqGAXcmb_PSU_q2,"This is the research question for the example I have chosen: Our goal is to show that young adults want to spend more minutes talking with their parents when they are thinking about mortality as opposed to dental pain.

The null hypothesis for this study is Ho=Mu1=Mu2. and the alternative hypothesis for this study is Ha: Mu1>Mu2. These would be the hypotheses because they describe the average minutes (numerical) and the population parameter for that is Mu. The null hypothesis would be that the two groups are equal because that shows no change and the alternative would be that group 1 spends more time than group 2, thus it would be a greater than symbol.

In this context, a type 1 error (false positive) would show that young adults do want to spend more time with their parents when talking about morality as opposed to dental pain, when in reality they do not, or there is no difference between the groups. In this context, a type 2 error (false negative) would show that young adults do not want to spend more time with parents when talking about morality vs dental pain when in reality they do. With each type of error made, there could be many potential consequences associated with each type of wrong decision. For instance, if a type 1 error is made, parents will feel that their kids will only want to spend more time with them when they are in pain. Where as if a type 2 error is made a consequence could be parents not talking about deep things with their children, like morality, and only thinking their child needs them when they are in pain.
